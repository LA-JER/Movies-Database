We are developing an easy-to-use Web Application that will:
 -Recommend new movies to users based on their review history and movie preferences (actors, genre, title etc).
 -Users will be asked to rate a few movies
 -Our algorithm  will then rank movies based on the similarity scores with the userâ€™s profile, and recommend the top-ranked movies
